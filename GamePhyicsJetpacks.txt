Game physics advertisement 

Here I'll be taking a scene from The Mandalorian that shows a Jetpack taking off from the ground and explain its concept and implementation in a game.  

It uses game physics concepts of gravity, inertia and effects of Newtonian Physics at a high speed. It will also display the physics element of thrust against gravity used in take off.
